# Semantic Treehouse Tutorial

Recognizing the complexity of semantic interoperability, the HEDGE-IoT project has prioritized the production and dissemination of clear, practical educational resources. This helps energy professionals, IT developers, and other stakeholders to understand and apply these concepts confidently, fostering innovation and practical adoption across Europe.

This section is dedicated to introduce the Sematic Treehouse.

We provide here a number of resources:

- The [Sematic Treehouse website](https://www.semantic-treehouse.nl/) 
- A [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/f-T1tcvAcQo) by our Hedge-IoT partner TNO (Wouter van der Berg) 
- The [slides](./Introduction_to_Semantic_Treehouse_slides.pdf) used in the video tutorial
