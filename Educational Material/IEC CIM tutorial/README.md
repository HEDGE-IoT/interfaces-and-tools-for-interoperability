# IEC CIM Tutorial

Recognizing the complexity of semantic interoperability, the HEDGE-IoT project has prioritized the production and dissemination of clear, practical educational resources. This helps energy professionals, IT developers, and other stakeholders to understand and apply these concepts confidently, fostering innovation and practical adoption across Europe.

This section is dedicated to introduce The IEC Common Information Model (CIM).

We provide here a number of resources:

* The [ENTSO-E CIM official page](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/)
