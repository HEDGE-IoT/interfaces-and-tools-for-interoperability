# SAREF Tutorial

Recognizing the complexity of semantic interoperability, the HEDGE-IoT project has prioritized the production and dissemination of clear, practical educational resources. This helps energy professionals, IT developers, and other stakeholders to understand and apply these concepts confidently, fostering innovation and practical adoption across Europe.

This section is dedicated to introduce SAREF, the Smart Applications REFerence ontology. 

We provide here a number of resources:
- The official [ETSI SAREF portal](https://saref.etsi.org/) 
- A [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/0KwAMFGQYaQ) by our partner TNO (Laura Daniele, Roderick van der Weert, Cornelis Bouter)  
- The [slides](./Introduction_to_SAREF_slides.pdf) used in the tutorial
